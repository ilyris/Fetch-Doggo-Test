This was booted up as a NextJs, this project doesn't really utilize SSR components, but I prefer Next-app > CRA

Here are links provided with some tech I used in this project. I will throw out the overall documentation for the technology, instead of individual links to each MUI component for instance.

**Project Tech**
MUI: https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/
Redux-Toolkit: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started
NextJS: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation
RTK Thunks: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk
Axios: https://axios-http.com/docs/intro.
React: https://react.dev/

**Some things I have considered on this project**
One: configured axios instance calls.
Two: more optimized and cleaner UI Search bar.
Three: More redux state cleanup -- I could / should move the Search state into it's own file, having three slices (form state, userSelectedBreeds).
